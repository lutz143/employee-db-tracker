## Description
The Employee Database Interface utilizes MySQL schemas and relational database management to modify and manipulate a backend SQL database through javascript and MySQL syntax to create a content management system (CMS). The app prompts the user to enter and view new departments, roles, and employees in order to organize an employee base quickly and easily.
